# Sports Analytics – Hands-On Projects

This package contains four ready-to-run projects that apply statistical and machine learning techniques to **sports performance** and **business analytics**.

## Projects
1. **Player Performance Regression (Cricket T20)** – Predict runs scored using recent form and context.
2. **Injury Risk Classification (GPS Load)** – Predict injury risk in the next 7 days.
3. **Football Win Probability** – Build and calibrate a home-win probability model with a live update demo.
4. **Dynamic Ticket Pricing** – Predict demand and find a price that maximizes revenue for an upcoming game.

## How to Use
- Open each notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.
- Datasets are in `datasets/`.
- Requires Python 3.9+ with: `pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`.

## Classroom Tips
- Split the class into 4 groups; assign one project each.
- Have each group present metrics, mistakes found via EDA, and one business recommendation.
- Stretch: add cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, or fairness checks (e.g., by position).
